TODO: Split game state tests into smaller files
TODO: Add some levels from Helge's game.
TODO: Make it impossible to re-enter the labyrinth if the exit has been walled up

BUG: Board scrambler crashes on non-quadratic boards
BUG: Game crashes when hamstering passable exit. Added dummy test, implement it and fix.

WISHLIST: Create level editor. Think a bit about how. New front-end is one option.
WISHLIST: Currently not making text available in UI on undo/redo. This should be simple enough to solve.
