TODO: Currently not making text available in UI on undo/redo. This should be simple enough to solve.
TODO: Implement board rotation. BoardLoader.cs.
TODO: Move BoardScrambler.cs + related classes to a separate folder. Perhaps related to board loading.
TODO: Split game state tests into smaller files

BUG: Game crashes when hamstering passable exit. Added dummy test, implement it and fix.
